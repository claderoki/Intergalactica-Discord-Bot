pigeon dating profiles

someone starts by enabled/setting up their dating profiles

they are DMed and asked questions:
    - write a description about your pigeon
    - choose an avatar

after their profile is set up they can choose to scroll through available pigeon bachelors and like them.
if both of them like eachother they get matched.
If they get matched .......... uhh what then?
    - Maybe both pigeons are asked a series of questions about themselves, if both have similar responses the date goes better??
